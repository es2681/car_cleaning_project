# Cleaning Data with SQL 

## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate my data cleaning skills in SQL. A csv file was uploaded into PostgreSQL to complete this task (see the "automobile_data" file). After reviewing and cleaning the data, the cleaned data was exported back into a csv document (see the "cleaned_automobile_data" file).
